    "The first useful equation for us is the [ideal gas law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law), which relates the pressure and volume of an ideal gas to it's temperature. In short: as the temperature of a gas increases, it's pressure and/or volume must also increase.  It is commonly stated as $PV = nR^*T$, but since it can be hard to count the number of molecules in some volume of gas, it is useful to transform into the molar form through some simple substitutions. The molar form is convenient in atmoshpheric science as we can more easily measure air pressure, temperature, and density."
